//to start the project, i started with ´npm create-react-app´
//this gived me a template of a simple app in react
//i just deleted the things that i considered were not necesary for this case.

import React, { Component } from 'react';

class App extends Component { //Main class
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
       
      </div>
    );
